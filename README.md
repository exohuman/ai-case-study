# Case Study: Hugging Face
## Overview and Origin

* _Name of company_
Hugging Face

* _When was the company incorporated?_
2016, per TechCrunch

* _Who are the founders of the company?_
According to TechCrunch, it was Clément Delangue and Julien Chaumond

* _How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?_
They created an AI chatbot that is "fun and emotional."

* _How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?_
They received $1.2 million from several investors including Betaworks and SV Angel (both are venture capital funds), and Kevin Durant, per TechCrunch.

## Business Activities

* _What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?_
In the TechCrunch article, it states the company was creating an AI chatbot for people to use as a digital friend they can text and send selfies to when their actual friends were busy.
Currently, according to the company’s website, the company hosts an AI platform which hosts code and provides services such as models, datasets, inference endpoints, servers, and guidance. Their stated goal is to “democratize _good_ machine learning, one commit at a time.”

* _Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?_
Based on the website, their customers are AI developers of all varieties from individuals to large companies. According to CNBC, last year they obtained backing from Amazon, Nvidia, Salesforce, AMD, Intel, IBM, and Qualcomm which raised their valuation to $4.5 billion.

* _What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)_
They already have an AI product that is in the App Store and in use. They have developed libraries, datasets, and other hosted solutions for people interested in AI.

* _Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)_
According to their site, they are using Git for their Hub, which hosts repositories created by their users. Their hub also hosts models, datasets, and “Spaces”. Spaces are a way to host machine learning demo apps on a person or organization’s profile page. They utilize Streamlit and Gradio, both of which turns Python scripts into web apps.
They also develop Transformers, which their site says, “provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models.” It works with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

## Landscape

* _What field is the company in?_
The company provides tools and services for those interested in machine learning, per their website.

* _What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?_
Machine learning has grown tremendously over the past ten years. For example, according to “Our World in Data”, AI systems were not reliable 10 years ago for the task of image recognition. Now they are beating humans in tests. They also state that the last decades saw a “continuous exponential increase in the computation used to train AI” and that “large language models have become much more powerful.”

* _What are the other major companies in this field?_
Github is also in the field of code hosting and their Copilot product uses AI to generate code. Another alternative is Google Vertex AI, which is a managed AI platform by Google which also provides many models and tools.

## Results

* _What has been the business impact of this company so far?_
This company has partnered with and received funding from many tech giants according to CNBC. According to their website, Hugging Face has many more enterprise users including Liberty Mutual, Uber, Cloudflare, Qualcomm, and many others. Coupled with its large $4.5 billion valuation, its impact has been large.

* _What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?_
A company like Hugging Face is dependent on users. They fortunately have many corporate users in addition to thousands of individual users. Their large valuation says that they are doing well.

* _How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?_
They are not as big as Google or Microsoft. They are a smaller company but have had an impact regardless of size due to their large user base.

## Recommendations

* _If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)_
I would suggest they offer a code completion plugin similar to Github Copilot.

* _Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?_
They offer many services that AI developers would be interested in. I think that since they already have the developer eye they should offer this service as well.

* _What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?_
Hugging Face’s chat already generates code but doesn’t do autocomplete. It would have to be offered as an extension for common editors like Vim, VS Code, and Intelli-J. So, I would advise them to use their current model (Hugging Face’s chat indicates they are using CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus) and concentrate on making the extension’s work.

* _Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?_
Their chat generates code already so one of the big challenges would be to integrate it into editors and IDEs. By concentrating on
some of the wider used general purpose editors they can reach more developers.
